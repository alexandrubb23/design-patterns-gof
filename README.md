## General info

This project is a simple oficial implementation patterns from the GoF (Gang of Four Design Patterns) book

## Technologies

Project is created with TypeScript.

## Installation

1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexandrubb23/design-patterns-gof.git
```

2. Navigate to the newly created directory

```bash
cd design-patterns-gof
```

3. Test the implementation

```bash
npm run test
```

## Memento Pattern

With Memento Pattern we can implement an undo mechanism.

See Memento Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/memento/memento.js
```

## State Pattern

State Pattern allows an object to behave differently when it state changes.

See State Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/state/state.js
```

## Iterator Pattern

With Iterator Pattern we can iterate over any kind of Data Structures without any breaking changes.

See Iterator Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/iterator/arrayIterator.js
```

## Strategy Pattern

With Strategy Pattern we can apply filtering or compress an image before we store it.

See Strategy Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/strategy/strategyPattern.js
```

## Template Method Pattern

With Template Method Pattern we can execute methods defines a template or skeleton for an operation.

See Template Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/template/templatePattern.js
```

## Command Pattern

With Command Pattern we can execute multiple commands in one go. For instance, Photoshop allows you to record your action(s) and replay them later.

See Command Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/command/commandPattern.js
```

## Observer Pattern

With Observer Pattern we can subscribe to the subject and get notified when the subject is changing his state.

See Observer Pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/observer/
```

With Observer Pattern ...

## Mediator Pattern

With Mediator Pattern we can define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Instead of objects communicating directly with each other, they communicate through a mediator object.

See Mediator pattern in action:

```bash
tsc && node dist/DesignPatterns/mediator/main.js
```
